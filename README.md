# John Baran Game Dev Homework 7 <br>

## Question 2 - Grid Snapping<br>
Grid snapping is a feature that will "snap" objects into place within the scene. This allows you to neatly lay out elements and evenly space them if needed. You can make the snap increments higher which will make the amount of distance an moves between snaps bigger. 

## Question 3 - Execute Always<br>
The [ExecuteAlways] attribute allows a script to run even when the game is not being played. This is helpful for this game because it lets the developer see the cube positions when they are laying them out, not just when the game is running. 

## Question 5 - LERP <br>
LERP is used to facilitate smooth transitions and movements for gameobjects from one place to another. The function takes three inputs: start position, end position, and travel percentage. The start and end positions are where the object moves between, and the travel percentage which how far in between the two positions the object will go. In our game we increment the percentage so that the object continuously moves to the destination.
